# Front Matter

Pages can contain an optional front matter. It can be used to define the page's description. The front matter must be the first thing in the file and must take the form of valid YAML set between triple-dashed lines.

The front matter can define variables of your own, they will be added to the page variable so you can use them in your templating.

```

description: This is a short description of my page

# The content of my page
