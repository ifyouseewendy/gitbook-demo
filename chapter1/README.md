`SUMMARY.MD` defines the structure of chapters and subchapters of the book and is used to generate the book's table of contents.

1. Valid (visiable) Markdown elements are: lists of links, headings, horizonal lines
2. Lists of links can be nested (multiple levels)
3. Headings display in the same level no matter you are using two `##` or four `####` level headings.
